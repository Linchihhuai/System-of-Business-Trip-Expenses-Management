My personal internship project at Haute Ecole Leonard de Vinci, Institut Paul Lambin and at the Belgian company Persolis located in Wallonia, Belgium. The name of the project means system of transport fee management in English. The project is originally named in French which is the company's professional language. It's a SAP project. The frontend is developped in SAPUI5 and the backend with Persolis' SAP system. The app helps company employees to record their commute to work and transmiss relavant commute data to the HR for remboursement.

### Technology
The main technology used for the project is SAP, a human ressource solution developped by a German company with the same name. SAP provides a wide range of modules for building web and mobile applications. There are the SAP modules used in my project: 

1. SAPUI5
SAPUI5 is a frontend library specifically designed for developping SAP apps. It allows developpers to quickly developpe a responsive professional grade graphical user interface for a SAP application.

2. SAP HR Time Management.
One of the sub modules of the Human Capital Management of the SAP ERP (Enterprise Ressource Planning) Solution. It provides a series of software that allows the human ressource of a company to efficiently manage their employees schedules. In my project, The Time Management Module contains information about an employee's work schedule such as their work routine, holidays, and hours of work per week. In my project, the Mudule is used to determine if a date is compensable by checking if a day is a work day or not. An employee's commute fee is compensated by the company only if a day is a work day. 

3. SAP HR Payroll Accounting.

4. SAP HR Organizational Management.
